//This class contains a list of data_size packets. This is substantially more than we necessarily need, given that any MATCH packet will reduce the number of packets by the match length. However, the idea is we will "mutate" the packets in this list, and packets that were skipped over due to a MATCH packet might become relevant if we, say, mutate it into a LITERAL.
