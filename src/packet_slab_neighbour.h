//This class makes a small modification to the PacketSlab. In the language of simulated annealing, when we make a small modifcation to the system we want to optimize, we say that we have "transitioned to a neighbour state". If this neighbour is not acceptable, we can undo it. This class is optimized to not make any heap allocations
